Being a Canadian University, Queen’s has different application requirements than most American schools. For students who attended high school in the United States, Queen’s requires students to have a minimum GPA of 3.0, taken four years of math and two years of english, and a minimum SAT score of 1200 or a minimum ACT score of 26. Queen’s also recommends students to write a “Personal Statement of Experience”, an essay where students can write “about [themselves] and what [they do] outside the classroom”. Canadian students are not required to submit standardized tests, however they are recommended to write a “Personal Statement of Experience”. In 2018, applications were due February 15th and applications were either accepted or denied by May 1st. Application deadlines were not posted for 2019, however it is likely that the dates will be similar. Queen’s university’s website has a “live chat” feature that allows students to interact with admissions officers at the university to ask questions about admission information.
